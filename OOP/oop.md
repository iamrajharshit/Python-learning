# OOP
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software in a way that models real-world entities and relationships.

## Classes and Objects
Class: Its a blueprint of an object.
Object: Its an instance of a class.


## Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.

Inheritance uses IS A relationship

### Types of Inheritance

- Single Inheritance
    - In single inheritance, a class inherits from one and only one parent class.

- Multiple Inheritance
    - In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit fromo more than one parent class.

- Multilevel Inheritance
    - In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class.


- Hierarchical Inheritance
    - In hierarchical inheritance, multiple classes  inherit from a single parent class.


- Hybrid Inheritance
    - Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It can be a mix of single, multiple, multilevel and hierarchical inheritance.




## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) together as a single unit or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which can be achieved using private variables and methods.

### Why encapsulation is required?
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in OOP that serves several important purposes.

#### Data Hiding
Encapsulation allows you to hide the internal state of an object and protect it from unauthorized access and modification. This means that the interal representation of an object can be changed without afffecting the code that uses the object.


## Polymorphism
Only method overriding is possible in Python.


## Abstraction
