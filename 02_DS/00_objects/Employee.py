'''
Objects and Classes are sort of like a gen. programming concepts
its a way of representing data in our programming languages.

Example: Employee
Employee has attributes, properties associated with it.
-name
-location 
-job title
-salary
our goal would be to represent all of the data in a single entity.

With object, we can represent all of this (attributes) in a single object.

defining methods helps us to interact us with the properties. 

A class, we are going to call it, what we want to call our object.
(In gen. we name the class same as the file name.)
Object is a single instance of a Class.
